make a maxArea variable and it a value (-infinity or INT_MIN) because we have to find the max.
take two pointers one points to the first element and other to the last element and make a currArea variable whose height is the min height from the both given heights and multiply it with the distance between pillars or height(difference in the index of both the heights)
traverse the whole array by the comparison according to the height.
assign maxArea the max of both the maxArea and the currArea.

int maxArea(vector& height) {

        int maxArea=INT_MIN,i=0,j=height.size()-1;
        while(i<j){
                 int currArea=min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i);
                if(height[i]<height[j]) i++;
                        
                else  j--;
                 maxArea=max(maxArea,currArea);
        }
        return maxArea;
    
}
